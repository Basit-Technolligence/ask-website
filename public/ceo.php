<p>I firmly believe that education is the basic right of all human beings living on this planet regardless of their social background. An educated nation is democratically stable and consistent in its economic viability, what I have learnt through my passion for education for the last Three decades.

Though the state is primarily responsible to eradicate illiteracy, this task cannot be accomplished without realization and joint endeavors by the stakeholders of our society.

In order to enable all individuals to reach and utilize their maximum potential, education is categorically imperative. Education also combats unemployment, confirms sound foundation of social equity, awareness, tolerance and spread of political socialization and cultural vitality. To meet such challenges we all need to extend helping-hand to one another.

I am proud of the fact that we have been able to make a remarkable contribution for quality education in Pakistan. We have, therefore, tried to share in the development of human resource capital from the general masses by providing affordable educational opportunities throughout Pakistan.

I hope and desire that our education system should produce responsible, enlightened citizens to align Pakistan with the global framework of economic and social prosperity. I am confident that our school will suffice this dire need of our society.

our school is another effort to remain on the leading role for literacy improvement in Pakistan. I therefore, welcome parents and their children to become part of our school family to grow together.

I believe it is today we must create the world of the future.</p>
<p>I hope to meet you at school when you visit.</p>
